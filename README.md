## CS15 Projects
These were the four large projects from [CS15 - Data Structures](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/15/) in Fall 2023 at Tufts University.
Each Project folder contains a comprehensive README, a source folder with the C++ source and a Makefile, and a tests folder with applicable tests for each project.

### Summaries
